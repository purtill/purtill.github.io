<h1>Dashboard</h1>

<div class="blurb">
	<h2>Choice of tool</h2>
	<p>Google’s Data Studio platform offers a free platform for dashboards and data visualisations.
    Although a number of alternative softwares exist, including Microsoft’s PowerBI tool that comes with Office365.
    A full account of options <a href=https://improvado.io/blog/tableau-vs-looker-vs-power-bi-vs-google-data-studio-vs-bigquery> at this link</a>.</p>
  <p>Google is provided as the prototype here because it was the tool I was introduced to and it is free to use for business use.
    Data is stored on Google Drive, so any expansion might require some input from IT and business process around data storage policy, or alternatively considering PowerBI much more.
